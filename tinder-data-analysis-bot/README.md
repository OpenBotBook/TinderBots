# Overview about the bot:

This code uses the Tinder API to authenticate with a Facebook token and ID, and then retrieves the user's profile data and recommendations data.
You can then use this data to perform data analysis, such as tracking the number of matches over time, or analyzing the characteristics of the people that the user is recommended to.

Please note that in order to use the Tinder API, you will need to provide your own Facebook token and ID, which you can obtain by logging in to Facebook and inspecting the network requests made by the Tinder app.
Also, be aware that the use of Tinder API is not officially supported and terms of service may change.
